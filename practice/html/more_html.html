<p> Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with <a href= "https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/tomatoes"><em>tomatoes</em></a>  , cheese, and various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] In formal settings, like a restaurant, pizza is eaten with knife and fork[citation needed], but in casual settings it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand. Small pizzas are sometimes called pizzettas.</p>

<p> The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[2] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[3] It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery.[3][4] Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.</p>

<p>The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.[5] In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish,[6][7] and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]</p>
